# funfactoid
This project is dedicated to the acquisition and distribution of fun, amusing, and hopefully true statements.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.5 or greater, sqlite3.
For now there is an autohotkey script to run on my spare laptop, which will send unsolicited fun facts in various chat windows. 
This may eventually be replaced with an API and a bot that makes use of that API.

# Setup

`python3 load_facts.py`

# Usage

`python3 random_fact.py`

# Long Term Vision

## Phase 1  (We are here)
Mine a few sources of fun facts from the internet, provide a means to display them

## Phase 2
Create the inverse of funfactoid - notfunfactoid. Which is identical to funfactoid, except the statements aren't fun or amusing, and the truth of the statement is irrelevent.

## Phase 3
By their powers combined, train an AI to determine whether statements are fun facts, and release funfactbot onto the internet to seize the world's strategic supply of fun facts.
